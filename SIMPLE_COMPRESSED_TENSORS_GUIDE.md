# Simple Compressed-Tensors Support (Single GPU)

## What Was Changed

I've **removed all tensor parallelism complexity** and kept it simple - just added support for compressed-tensors (NVFP4, etc.) to the existing single-GPU Transformers backend.

### Changes Made

**1. `eval/compare_q_transformers.py`**
- ✅ Added `CompressedLinear` import (with fallback if not installed)
- ✅ Added `CompressedLinear` detection in `get_storage_info()` by class name
- ✅ Added proper BPW calculation for compressed layers
- ✅ Added skip logic in `torch.nn.Linear` check to avoid duplicate handling
- ❌ **REMOVED** all tensor parallel functions
- ❌ **REMOVED** all multi-GPU complexity

**2. `eval/compare_q.py`**
- ❌ **REMOVED** tensor parallel imports and registrations
- ✅ Back to original simple structure

**Result:** The script now works **exactly like the original**, but can handle compressed-tensors models on a **single GPU**.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Get a Small Model

You need a model that fits on ONE GPU. Examples:
- 7B model @ 4-bit NVFP4: ~4-5 GB VRAM
- 13B model @ 4-bit NVFP4: ~7-8 GB VRAM  
- 30B model @ 4-bit NVFP4: ~16-18 GB VRAM
- 70B model @ 4-bit NVFP4: ~35-40 GB VRAM

**Which models are in the comparison chart you showed?** 
Let me know the model name/size and I'll help you set it up.

### Step 2: Edit the Spec File

Edit `eval/spec/small_nvfp4_transformers.json`:

```json
[
    {
        "load_fn": "transformers_auto",
        "fwd_fn": "transformers",
        "label": "NVFP4 7B",
        "model_dir": "/path/to/your/7b/nvfp4/model"
    }
]
```

**Replace** `/path/to/your/7b/nvfp4/model` with your actual model path.

### Step 3: Edit the Data Spec

Edit `eval/spec/wiki2_small_model.json`:

```json
{
    "tokenize_fn": "transformers",
    "tokenizer_dir": "/path/to/your/7b/nvfp4/model",
    "dataset": "wiki2",
    "eval_stride": 512,
    "eval_len": 2048,
    "max_rows": 20
}
```

**Replace** the tokenizer_dir with the same path as your model.

**Note:** This uses the **standard 2048 context** from the comparison chart.

### Step 4: Run the Benchmark

```bash
cd ~/vllm/exllamav3

# Make sure compressed-tensors is installed
pip install compressed-tensors

# Run the benchmark
python eval/compare_q.py \
    -d eval/spec/wiki2_small_model.json \
    -m eval/spec/small_nvfp4_transformers.json
```

## Expected Output

```
Loading dataset: wiki2
Loading: /path/to/your/7b/nvfp4/model
Loading checkpoint shards: 100%|████████| X/X [00:XX<00:00]
Loaded transformers model: 4.00 bpw (decoder), 4.00 bpw (head)
Testing: /path/to/your/7b/nvfp4/model (NVFP4 7B)

Evaluating: 100%|█████████████████████████| 20/20 [XX:XX<00:00]

Perplexity: 7.234567
```

## What Models to Use

From the comparison chart you showed, typical models would be:

**Llama 3.1 8B:**
- Size: ~8 GB VRAM @ 4-bit
- Path example: `/media/fmodels/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/NVFP4/`

**Llama 3.2 1B:**
- Size: ~1 GB VRAM @ 4-bit
- Path example: `/media/fmodels/llama-3.2-1b/NVFP4/`

**Which model do you want to benchmark?** Tell me:
1. Model name/size
2. Where it's located
3. I'll create the exact spec files for you

## Why This Is Better

| Before (Tensor Parallel) | After (Simple) |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| ❌ Complex multi-GPU logic | ✅ Simple single-GPU |
| ❌ Memory distribution issues | ✅ Straightforward |
| ❌ OOM on 123B model | ✅ Works on models that fit |
| ❌ Hard to debug | ✅ Easy to understand |
| ❌ Shotty and bad (your words!) | ✅ Clean and reliable |

## Technical Details

### What the CompressedLinear Support Does

```python
# Detects CompressedLinear by class name (works even if import fails)
is_compressed = (check_isinstance(module, [CompressedLinear]) or 
                module.__class__.__name__ == 'CompressedLinear')

if is_compressed:
    # Sum all compressed parameters
    module_bits = get_tensors_size(dict(module.named_parameters()))
    module_numel = module.in_features * module.out_features
    # Calculate BPW
    bpw = module_bits / module_numel
```

### How It's Different from Original

**Original `compare_q_transformers.py`:**
- Only handled: Linear, GPTQ, AWQ, AQLM, VPTQ, BitsAndBytes
- Would crash on CompressedLinear with "no attribute 'weight'"

**Modified version:**
- Also handles: **CompressedLinear** (NVFP4, NVFP8, etc.)
- Detects by class name as fallback
- Skips CompressedLinear in Linear check to avoid double-counting

## Files to Ignore

You can ignore these files - they were part of the failed tensor parallel attempt:

- `eval/spec/behemoth_nvfp4_transformers.json` (was for 123B model)
- `eval/spec/wiki2_behemoth*.json` (was for 123B model)
- `eval/run_nvfp4_benchmark.sh` (was for tensor parallel)
- `eval/NVFP4_OOM_SOLUTIONS.md` (was for OOM issues)
- `eval/TRANSFORMERS_TENSOR_PARALLEL_GUIDE.md` (was for tensor parallel)
- `PERPLEXITY_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md` (still relevant for understanding)

## What You Need to Tell Me

1. **Which model** from the comparison chart do you want to benchmark?
   - Model name (e.g., "Llama 3.1 8B")
   - Model size (7B, 13B, etc.)

2. **Where is it located?**
   - Full path to the model directory
   - Should contain: `config.json`, `*.safetensors`, tokenizer files

3. **Is it NVFP4 quantized?**
   - Or another compressed-tensors format?

Once you tell me this, I'll create the exact spec files with the right paths and you can run it immediately.

## Ready to Run

The code is ready! Just need:
1. Your model path
2. Update the two spec files
3. Run the command

**What model do you want to benchmark?**
